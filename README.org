* Description

Suite of programs for analysis of datacubes from the Phab-C² radiation-MHD code. Currently focused on magnetized HII regions. 

These would also work on FITS files of the same variables from ohter sources.

* Base variables
+ dd :: gas density
+ pp :: gas thermal pressure
+ b[xyz] :: B-field (units with μ₀ = 1)
+ v[xyz] :: velocity
+ x[ni] :: ionized and neutral hydrogen fractions

* Some hilights
** Calculating auxiliary variables

*** cubet.f90
Calculates the gas temperature
*** cubextras.f90
** Movies

** Statistics
